# A Wordle Project. Readme to be updated soon.

A Wordle game to practice some of my React skills. The game was mainly built to _improve and test_ my React knowledge. Fun little project.

There are numerous improvements that can be made to the game. This serves as a basic skeleton, so there are bugs that need to be washed out. Maybe someday, hm?

### Known bugs so far and QOL issues (possible note for future?):

- Bad keyboard layout. Probably should make it match that of a real keyboard.
- Keyboard layout color bug where reusing a letter replaces the initial status (correct, misplaced).
- Words can be repeated.
- Potential for code refactoring.
- probably more too?
